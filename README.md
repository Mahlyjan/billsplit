<h1><b>Calculate-What-I-Owe:</b></h1>
<p><b>Problem Statement</b></p>
Ever gone out for a meal with friends at a restaurant, everyone ordering different meals at varying prices? To make things simpler, people simply divide the entire meal by the number of people, amirite? But is this fair?

With this simple application, I enable everyone to calculate accurately what the owe to the one who paid the bill first. 

This project will be hosted on github pages at: https://mahlyjan.github.io/billsplit/

<h3><b>To run this application:</b></h3>
1) git clone the code repository to your local machine to a directory of your choice. (Desktop is a good start. Easily accessible)
2) "cd billsplit"
3) Run "npm install" on your terminal to ensure that your node modules have been installed.
4) Once that is done, simply run "npm start" to start running the project on localhost:3000.

<h3><b>This project is missing:</b></h3>

1) Unit testing. Will have to add this at some point eventually.

2) White spaces are not allowed in the "Amount I Owed" section. I have tackled it by inserting an error message for now but maybe i can fix it next time properly.

3) Inserting a 00 in any of the fields might cause a BLANK SCREEN error. Please kindly refresh the app.
